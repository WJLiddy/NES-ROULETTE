# NES-ROULETTE
Short ruby program that launches NES roms via Nestopia in random order. For windows only, but linux soon.

To build:
You need ruby, shoes (the GUI toolkit), Nestopia, and some roms.
Put the Nestopia folder in the same directory as the program.
Put legally owned and/or freeware roms in a "/roms" directory. They should be named using the GoodTools convention.
Run the program: "shoes NES-ROULETTE.rb"
